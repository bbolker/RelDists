The ranges of the two parameters are clearly demarcated to separate these classes. It thus provides an alternative to many existing life distributions. Details of parameter estimation are provided through a Weibull-type probability plot and maximum likelihood. We also derive explicit formulas for the turning points of the failure rate function in terms of its parameters.

@article{Mahmoudi2013,
abstract = {In this paper we propose a new four-parameters distribution with increasing, decreasing, bathtub-shaped and unimodal failure rate, called as the exponentiated Weibull-Poisson (EWP) distribution. The new distribution arises on a latent complementary risk problem base and is obtained by compounding exponentiated Weibull (EW) and Poisson distributions. This distribution contains several lifetime sub-models such as: generalized exponential-Poisson (GEP), complementary Weibull-Poisson (CWP), complementary exponential-Poisson (CEP), exponentiated Rayleigh-Poisson (ERP) and Rayleigh-Poisson (RP) distributions. We obtain several properties of the new distribution such as its probability density function, its reliability and failure rate functions, quantiles and moments. The maximum likelihood estimation procedure via an EM-algorithm is presented in this paper. Sub-models of the EWP distribution are studied in details. In the end, applications to two real data sets are given to show the flexibility and potentiality of the new distribution. {\textcopyright} 2013 IMACS.},

abstract = {A two shape parameter generalization of the well known family of the Weibull distributions is presented and its properties are studied. The properties examined include the skewness and kurtosis, density shapes and tail character, and relation of the members of the family to those of the Pear-sonian system. The members of the family are grouped in four classes in terms of these properties. Also studied are the extreme value distributions and the limiting distributions of the extreme spacings for the members of the family. It is seen that the generalized Weibull family contains distributions with a variety of density and tail shapes, and distributions which in terms of skewness and kurtosis approximate the main types of curves of the Pearson system. Furthermore, as shown by the extreme value and extreme spacings distributions the family contains short, medium and long tailed distributions. The quantile and density quantile functions are the principle tools used for the structural analysis of the family.},

abstract = {The Weibull family with survival function exp{\{}-(y/$\sigma$){\textless}sup{\textgreater}$\alpha${\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\}}, for $\alpha$ {\textgreater} 0 and y ≥ 0, is generalized by introducing an additional shape parameter $\theta$. The space of shape parameters $\alpha$ {\textgreater} 0 and $\theta$ {\textgreater} 0 can be divided by boundary line $\alpha$ = 1 and curve $\alpha$$\theta$ = 1 into four regions over which the hazard function is, respectively, increasing, bathtub-shaped, decreasing, and unimodal. The new family is suitable for modeling data that indicate nonmonotone hazard rates and can be adopted for testing goodness of fit of Weibull as a submodel. The usefulness and flexibility of the family is illustrated by reanalyzing five classical data sets on bus-motor failures from Davis that are typical of data in repair-reuse situations and Efron's data pertaining to a head-and-neck-cancer clinical trial. These illustrative data involve censoring and indicate bathtub, unimodal, and increasing but possibly non-Weibull hazard-shape models.},
